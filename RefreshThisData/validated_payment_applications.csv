It handles card not present transactions. Card present transactions are handled by the terminal that holds all necessary logic and functions for carrying out a payment card transaction with or without using a PIN. Data sent from BPTI to the terminal is transaction amount, and if from a manually-entered card not present transaction, data includes PAN and expiry date only. When accepting loyalty cards which are not co-branded with any of the card brands, non PCI relevant track2 data may be transmitted from the terminal to BPTI, but only if the card is indicated as a loyalty card in the terminals BIN table and only if it is a non payment card. For co-branded loyalty cards only loyalty member information is used from track 3 or chip card tag 9Fxx, but only if it doesnt contain any PCI relevant track 2 equivalent data. The BIN table settings are declared by the processor and acquirer Swedbank Card Services (previously named Swedbank Babs) and are downloaded to the terminal in signed files. BPTI is a middleware application designed to facilitate communication between Babs Paylink or Point terminals and third party POS applications residing on a POS. Card present credit and PIN based transactions are handled by the terminal and sent for authorization to the processor directly and never to BPTI. The terminal does not allow for manually entered card not present transactions. Manually entered card not present transactions are handled by merchant staff only. The manually entered transactions are handled when the chip or the magnetic stripe is broken and when the customer are disabled. BPTI only receives cardholder data when manually entered via a third party POS application. BPTI receives this data to forward it to the terminal for authorization. Card not present transactions handled by BPTI are only handled in VRAM. BPTI instructs the terminal to carry out a transaction for a specific amount. BPTI does not perform settlement, and the terminal uses the draft capture protocol so the authorization is the settlement. When financial transactions are made, cards are read by the terminal and chargeback transactions are performed just like payment transactions with the original card needing to be present. Since BPTI is written in non-visual ActiveX, it may be run on the client side of a web-based POS solution. Since BPTI is written in ActiveX, it needs a client application that uses ActiveX, and a payment terminal that uses the LPP SE implementation protocol. The terminal is a PED and communicates with the processor directly. Babs Paylink provides the BPTI application and which the integrators incorporate in the POS application which is delivered to the merchant. There are no other third party applications required to run BPTI. Babs Paylink also provides the terminal used together with BPTI."

When WM-card is used to process transactions related to fuel delivery, the final transaction amount is not known and in this situation the merchant requests pre-authorisation. The pre-authorisation message containing sensitive cardholder data (including full track, encrypted PIN block and PAN) is passed to WMcard as an ISO 8583-1100 message over TCP sockets. This sensitive cardholder data is held in volatile RAM at all times until a response is received from the host and is never stored in non-volatile storage.

WM-card does not process chargeback requests. Cardholder data handled by the application includes the PAN, full track 2 data, PINs and Encrypted PIN Blocks. WM-card does not ever handle card verification codes (CVV2). The PAN is the only sensitive data stored after authorisation and it is encrypted wherever it is stored using 3DES with 128-bit key. When WM-card is used to process transactions related to fuel delivery, the final transaction amount is not known and in this situation the merchant requests pre-authorisation. The pre-authorisation message containing sensitive cardholder data (including full track, encrypted PIN block and PAN) is passed to WMcard as an ISO 8583-1100 message over TCP sockets. This sensitive cardholder data is held in volatile RAM at all times until a response is received from the host and is never stored in non-volatile storage. WM-card only handles the PIN (distinct from encrypted PIN block) during a PIN change operation. PIN changes are only possible for proprietary cards such as fuel cards or loyalty cards (not scheme branded cards). PIN changes are only possible for fuel or loyalty cards that are defined within the WM-card system, there is no transmission of the PIN to a third party system."

Additional components include team member management, system setup and configura-tion, store management, time clock, and a web service for handling Internet orders.  Credit card payments are processed by Pulse in one of 3 ways: 1.	On premise Ordering: Payment information (PAN, expiration date, cardholder name) is entered into Pulse either manually or with a magnetic swipe reader by a store employee.  The payment information is then transmitted to either Paymentech or the ACI Gateway for authorization.  2.	Remote Ordering: Pulse processes credit card payments that it receives from a separate hosted online ordering system or from a Domino's call center.  Payment information (PAN, expiration date, cardholder name) along with the order is sent to the store's Pulse system for processing via the Pulse web service. 3.

Centricity Portal is integrated with Credit Card Core of the GE Centricity Business Payment Authorization Module V2.0 for credit card transactions.   This integration allows GEHC customers to process patient payments to pay off services with a credit card. The transaction information (amount, PAN, expiration date and name) is entered into the Centricity Portal application, transmitted to the Credit Card Core and then onto a payment gateway.  In return, Credit Card Core returns a token (for transaction reference), the payment gateway sends an authorization number back to the Credit Card Core which is returned to the Centricity Portal application along with the reference token. The Payment Authorization module uses a subsystem called the Credit Card Core of the GE Centricity Business Payment Authorization Module V2.0 that securely accepts sensitive credit card data. This includes an intermediary secure server to connect the system to a gateway provider.

CPS provides Card-Not-Present settlement to complete the payment transactions between organizations and banks. CPS is not a SAAS solution, and it aims to establish a new payment model. Telecom service provider uses CPS to provide payment related services to its connected organizations and organization's customers, and the CPS provides a payment method for the organizations and their customers when no convenient bank services are provided to the individual customers in the implementation scenario. Instead of the usage of traditional payment methods like cash, check or credit cards provided by banks, only organization needs to register its bank card into the CPS system, and the customer of the organization can register his/her own CPS user account by using his/her mobile phone number under the organization's account. Then a customer of organization can use the mobile phone to transfer money, pay for goods and services, and distribute bulk payments such as salaries and welfare payments based on mobile technology (e.g. Unstructured Supplementary Service Data (USSD), SIM Application Toolkit (STK), mobile app, etc.). All the money changes on customer's CPS user account will be recorded into the CPS system and reflected on the organization's bank account. CPS system uses Electronic funds transfer (EFT) file to finalize the settlement with the bank in a pre-defined time period."

The TranScend Servers must be running in order to use TranScend Client to process transactions. . File System Driver: The design of the filter driver allows for the secure handling of files written to a predefined location. This protected location will be set in the registry via an IOCTL call through the filter driver and during installation of the product. When a file is written to this location, the driver will not actually write any data to disk. However, an empty file of the same name will exist on disk in the specified location. This marker file will be used in the directory scan for files in the traditional manner. All of the read/write requests for this file will operate on an in-memory representation of the file. When the file is eventually closed, the in-memory buffer will be encrypted (128-bit AES) and added to a queue. The empty placeholder file on disk will persist. TranScend supports both credit card and debit card (PIN-based) transactions, including support for all major brand payment cards. TranScend v3.0 payment application takes both card-present transactions and card-not-present transactions/manual-entry-of-PAN transactions. For card-not-present, the PAN and the expiration date are required; CVV2 is not required, but can be input. Sensitive authentication data (Track data, CVV2 and PIN block data) are held in volatile RAM only before authorization. After authorization, the sensitive authentication data is cleared from VRAM and not retained. If there is a connection failure, the application will wait for 90 seconds and then drop all cardholder data from the VRAM; the cardholder or the merchant employee needs to re-swipe the card. Full PANs are encrypted with 128-bit AES and stored in the database. The application supports chargeback and settlement. PANs stored in the database can be accessed by the application.

It is a bank card payment acceptance system, which uses the merchants' ECR and PIN Pad to complete bank card payment transactions through the merchant's LAN, and reroute it to acquiring bank through a dedicated line for card authorization. During the implementation phase, JiaLi Xingye (the PA vendor) provides the BankPos application and Oracle Database; Acquiring bank provides server hardware, router and PIN pad while the merchant provides a firewall, dedicated line, and the ECR. BankPos accepts payments by swiping a customer's credit or debit card and entering PIN data on the attached PIN pad. When a card is swiped on the PIN pad, the captured track data and PIN data are encrypted by the PIN pad and transmitted to the BankPos client in ECR via serial port. Once received by the ECR, the encrypted data resides only in the volatile RAM of the ECR and then is rerouted to the BankPos server via TCP/IP protocol immediately. Once received by the BankPos server, the encrypted data from ECR is sent to the acquiring bank without any modification. Prior to authorization all cardholder data exists only in the volatile RAM of the BankPos server and the ECR. Upon receipt of the authorization reply from the bank, the BankPos server saves the truncated PAN with the first six and last four digits of PAN left to Oracle database and transaction log files. Once the data is successfully stored in the database, the original data in the volatile RAM of the BankPos server is dropped and the authorization response is sent to the ECR. Once the ECR receives the response, it displays it on the screen. At this point, the cardholder data in the volatile RAM of ECR is dropped."

The transaction host handles the settlement. NetPOS does not support chargebacks, but does support credits. For credits, the original card and cardholder need to be present and the card needs to be swiped or manually entered again. NetPOS is a web-based payment system. The ICR or Intelligent Caching Router is shipped to the customer as a black box. The ICR runs a web server that is used to serve the payment application. The customer has no access to the operating system on the ICR. The customer receives the ICR from NetPOS and only has to provide machines to run Windows and Firefox 3.5, which act as payment terminals. Usually these are sold to the merchant and installed by third party integrators."

The application performs authorization, but no settlement or chargeback. KioskWorks has a simple user interface for card transactions and the code is integrated with a PAYware SIM DLL that interfaces to a VeriFone swipe device and IPCharge, a processor multiplexer. KioskWorks controls the PAYware SIM DLL, which accepts swipes on command from KioskWorks. KioskWorks does not allow any user input. It can perform credit transactions, and CVV2 and PIN data are never collected. KioskWorks receives the card data, reformats it and sends it to the PAYware SIM DLL which then formats the card data again and sends it to an IPCharge back-end payment engine when KioskWorks tells the DLL to do so. KioskWorks commands the PAYware SIM DLL to set certain communication parameters and to send IPCharge an XML string it has containing the card data it wants to authorize. KioskWorks builds the XML string for PAYware SIM DLL to send. KioskWorks sets up the URL and communication parameters in a command to the PAYware SIM DLL. The PAYware SIM DLL sends the authorization request using a secure HTTPS POST operation. Communication is over SLL Version 3.

The application performs authorization, but not settlement or chargeback. KioskWorks has a simple user interface for card transactions and the code is integrated with a PAYware SIM DLL that interfaces to a VeriFone swipe device and IPCharge, a processor multiplexer. KioskWorks controls the PAYware SIM DLL, which accepts swipes on command from KioskWorks. KioskWorks does not allow any user input. It can perform credit transactions, and CVV2 and PIN data are never collected. KioskWorks receives the card data, reformats it and sends it to the PAYware SIM DLL which then formats the card data again and sends it to an IPCharge back-end payment engine when KioskWorks tells the DLL to do so. KioskWorks commands the PAYware SIM DLL to set certain communication parameters and to send IPCharge an XML string it has containing the card data it wants to authorize. KioskWorks builds the XML string for PAYware SIM DLL to send. KioskWorks sets up the URL and communication parameters in a command to the PAYware SIM DLL. The PAYware SIM DLL sends the authorization request using a secure HTTPS POST operation. Communication is over SLL Version 3.

As a client, the payment application resides on every POS system as libraries for the merchants POS software to integrate with. These are DLLs on Windows systems or .so libraries on Linux systems. The merchants POS software interfaces in two ways: 1. The POS software calls the SiTef libraries and passes it cardholder data through function calls in volatile memory. 2. The POS software writes a file to disk with only the amount. The SiTef library is called, which reads the file, opens its own GUI dialogue, and gathers the cardholder data from the cashier. It then writes a file with receipt info to disk. The receipt has truncated PAN (first 6 and last 4 digits); cardholder data is never written to disk. As a server, the payment application is located at a central location and receives payment transactions from the POS systems, which it then routes to the correct processor. The application processes both card present credit, card not present and PIN based debit transactions. It collects PAN, PIN data, track data, and CVV2 data. It stores the PAN in a .dat file ( encrypted AES 128) only before authorization. The application does not perform settlement or chargebacks. It has no web-based components. Only software is provided by the vendor. The merchant must provide PC workstation hardware or a VeriFone terminal for the POS System, and a PC workstation for the SiTef Server."

The user interface is configurable to suit many variants in the dry cleaning industry. The application stores PAN, expiry date, and cardholder name in its AES 256-bit encrypted database tables. The application is Windows-based and is designed to function on any Intel platform supporting the Microsoft Windows 2003 or XP runtime environment. SPOT must be run only under Microsoft Windows 2003 or XP SP3 operating systems. SPOT will not run under Windows 95, 98, or ME. The application is comprised of a client workstation, an application server and a Microsoft database server running Windows SQL Server (2000, 2005 or Express). The application uses a SQL-based Microsoft database (2000, 2005 or Express) that must be provided by the customer. The SQL database runs on Windows Server 2005. A SQL Express Desktop Engine (MSDE) can be used for systems with less than six users. A free SQL Express Desktop Engine is included on the installation CDROM and if used, should be installed prior to installing SPOT. Optionally upgrading the MSDE to SQL 2005 Server can be performed after SPOT is fully installed. Management utilities provided with Microsoft Access are compatible with the MSDE. SPOT recommends the installation of Microsoft Office 2000 Professional with the MSDE engine since it contains Access and its associated compatible database utilities. SPOT is sold as a software package only. The customer must provide the Intel based hardware used, including all servers and communications equipment. The application performs settlement. 256-bit AES encrypted PANs can be accessed by the application server via SQL queries. The application does perform chargeback and accesses 256-bit AES encrypted PAN from its database to do this."

See the Figure 3-1, Typical Retail Processing Environment, below for a diagram showing this configuration. SPM 2005-S is a Microsoft Windows based middleware application that runs on Windows 2000 or Windows XP Professional with SP3. SPM 2005-S was developed to facilitate the flow of payment card transaction authorization requests from the integrated POS terminal payment application to the processing bank. The application accepts requests for credit card present and card not present data in the form of a data stream from the POS terminal. SPM 2005-S does not distinguish whether the card data was from a swipe or a user interface of a POS terminal. SPM 2005-S does not perform debit with PIN transactions since it does not handle PINs. SPM 2005-S receives card data from the POS terminal application, reformats it and sends it to the processor using 128-bit SSL V3. The authorization requests from SPM 2005-S contain cardholder data including PAN, expiration date, cardholder name and optionally, sensitive authentication CVV2 codes. SPM 2005-S does not perform settlement or charge backs, only authorizations. The application does not at anytime store cardholder data in any location other than its VRAM. Subsequent to authorization, all cardholder data collected for the transaction is dropped from the SPM 2005-S systems VRAM. SPM 2005-S accepts cardholder data directly from a POS terminal, and runs on a Windows XP Professional SP3 or a Windows 2000 host, with the latest service packs, supplied by the merchant. The installer does an automatic host inventory and checks that all the recent OS patches are applied before allowing SPM 2005-S to be installed. SPM 2005-S does not provide web-based functionality. SPM 2005-S does not use wireless technology."

Transactions originate from two locations, inside the store at a register, or outside in the fuel forecourt. At the register inside, the cardholder data is collected by the application. Outside the cardholder data is collected by the fuel dispenser's Dispenser Card Reader (DCR), sent to the Dispenser Interface Hardware, which sends it to the NBSpak application. The application processes card present (Track data, PIN data) transactions with card swipes inside or outside. The application also processes card-not-present (PAN) transactions via manual entry at the inside register. Card validation values are never collected. The application performs settlement at the end of the day, or when a certain number of transactions have occurred. Because of the limited space available, a maximum of ~3 days of data can be stored in the small, battery-powered RAM. The application does not perform chargebacks.

The software is customized to work with a specific processor. Shell has contracted VeriFone to modify this software to work with the Shell payment gateway (and First Data for debit transactions). This customized software is labeled SHOPAK. Part of this modification included upgrades to various systems to meet PA-DSS compliance. SHOPAK requires the use of a Sapphire site controller. There is no Ruby only SHOPAK configuration. Although SHOPAK can run in a Sapphire/Topaz/Ruby configuration, VeriFone only supports Sapphire/Topaz and Sapphire/Ruby configurations. SHOPAK uses the Sapphire as the site controller, and the Topaz and Ruby systems as payment terminals. SHOPAK is a suite of applications that run on Sapphire, Topaz and Ruby machines. At a minimum, a Sapphire and one payment terminal is required. This payment terminal can be either Ruby or Topaz. SHOPAK is sold to merchants as a complete networked system. This system includes a layer 3 filtering router that is preconfigured by VeriFone and a stand-alone Windows-based PC (referred to as the V950 or HPV20) that is used to connect to the web-based configuration tool. The router, V950 and HPV20 do not run SHOPAK software and were not included in the scope of the validation. SHOPAK supports card present credit, manual key entry credit and debit transactions. Although SHOPAK on Sapphire/Topaz and Sapphire/Rubysupports manual key entry transactions, it currently does not accept, store or transmit any card validation values, since the Shell host does not currently support the use of CVV2 for transaction authorization. Shell has the ability to turn on CVV2 prompting at a time of their choosing. The GemPro board in the Sapphire is configured using a file that is downloaded from the Shell payment gateway. The configuration options govern certain configurable features of SHOPAK, including acceptable BIN ranges, whether or not CVV2 values are prompted for, how PANs are masked and truncated, and whether or not PANs are truncated on journal tape for troubleshooting and manual reporting features. SHOPAK does support store and forward functionality. Track data is written, encrypted using 128-bit AES, to the store and forward file on the GemPro board in the Sapphire during offline mode. After the system regains network connectivity and processes the transactions, the file is securely deleted by writing over the files with zeroes. SHOPAK can initiate settlement; however, no PAN data is sent for settlement. All settlement data is stored on the Shell payment gateway. Settlement occurs on the payment gateway at Shell automatically at 2AM daily. SHOPAK on Sapphire/Topaz and Sapphire/Ruby does not support chargebacks. SHOPAK on Sapphire/Topaz and Sapphire/Ruby is not part of a web-based payment system. The Sapphire system does include a web service, but it is used only for reporting and management purposes and not for processing card data. This service is not accessible via the Internet and is only used internally. In this sense, SHOPAK does contain web-based components making requirement 5.2 in scope for this assessment but would not be considered a web-based payment system. VeriFone provides all hardware required for transaction processing. The merchant needs to provide a method for processing transactions. For SHOPAK, all transactions are performed via the RS-232 port that is connected to an external, third party serial to VSAT converter."

The Payment Application provides an EFT system that can be configured for all major banks. The Payment Application is used to process credit and debit card transactions from Zonal terminals and ensures that transaction details are verified and the payment goes to appropriate banks. At the end of the business day, the Payment Application controls the submission of funds to the banks. It can either be configured for polling by the bank or consolidated bulk delivery to the bank. In the latter case, the outlets send funds to the head office, which in turn submits the whole company's funds to the bank in one transaction, saving on polling fees.  The Payment Application is dependent on third party products for authorisation and settlement processes, as follows:  .	ACK's ECP (EFT Control Program) V1.38, and ACK's BDS (Bulk Delivery System) V1.38, build 090901p15, within the UK; .	Mercury's MercuryPay 1.1.0, DSI Client V2.5.0 which is based on NETePay V4, supplied by DataCap, within the US; .	Verifone's PCCharge V5.8, within the US."
